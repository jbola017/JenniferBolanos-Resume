        <p class="lead mb-4">I am 19 years old and I am a currently a second year, Liberal Studies major at the University of California, Riverside. I am expected to graduate in June of 2026.  My favorite hobbies are listening to music and art. I like to learn about different cultures and love to go on adventures which is why one of my many goals is to be able to travel the world. UC Riverside has always been my dream school since the 6th grade. I went on a field trip to UCR and fell in love with the school. I am the first in my Mexican household to go to college and I come from Moreno Valley, California. I graduated from Moreno Valley High School and received my high school diploma in June 2022. My goal is to get my bachelor of arts in Liberal Studies, get my teaching credential, and masters in Education all here at UC Riverside to become an elementary school teacher at Moreno Valley Unified School District, which is the district in my city. <br><br>

        Since I was a child, I always wanted to be a teacher. I would always imagine how my classroom would look like and I always thought about how many kids I would be able to help learn. I was very inspired by my own elementary school teachers, especially my 5th grade teacher. My 5th grade teacher cared and helped me so much that I want to be someone like her. I want students to like learning and have a teacher, just like I did, that saw them and would do anything to help them go above and beyond. <br><br>

        At the moment, I have two jobs. I work part-time as an AVID Tutor at Moreno Valley Unified District at the high school I went too. I started working as an AVID Tutor the year after I graduated. AVID is a college preparatory program for 3rd-12th grade students. As tutors, we guide and motivate students to go to college. We teach them how to communicate and collaborate with one another and to stay organized and be at top of things. This gives them an idea on how college is so once they are at their dream college, they are confident and ready. I've been in the AVID program as a student myself from middle school all throughout high school so I have experience of how the program works and goes. My second job is a seasonal bookseller at the Barnes and Noble at the UC Riverside campus. I make sure the bookstore is clean and organized. As well as helping out customers to find what they need whether it be school supplies or textbooks. Many of the customers are students so we want to make sure students specifically get all the resources they need to get through the school year. I am a very kind hearted, reliable, intelligent, and determined individual, I would like my future to be successful and I hope to accomplish all my dreams.
